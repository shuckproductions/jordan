Hi! I’m Jordan. I’m 17 years old from Blackpool, Lancashire. I’m an aspiring filmmaker/director/actor. I currently attend Baines Sixth form, in upper sixth where I am studying Biology, ICT and Media Studies. 

Each week I go to Scream Theatre Schools where I am trained in all three disciplines. Also I am an active member of Blackpool Scouts where I am a young leader at 1st Bispham Scout and Guide Group, a part of the production team for Blackpool Gang Show and the Media & Communications Editor for the Blackpool District. 

Most recently have started making short films and promotional materials for myself and others. If you want to view my films/videos please look at the 'Productions' section on my site.
