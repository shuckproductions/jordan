I'm 19, have a love for broadcasting and I'm studying BA (Hons) Television and Radio at the University of Salford based at MediaCityUK.

Blackpool born and bred. Who doesn't love the going up the tower, riding the Big One, seeing the illuminations and a little stick of Blackpool rock? (cue George Formby)

I am a presenter at Shock Radio, Manchester's biggest student radio station. Why not tune in on Thursdays at 10am on <a href="shockradio.co.uk"> shockradio.co.uk. </a>

Original broadcast television is where my love of the media lies; more specifically British TV fictions such as: Fawlty Towers, Doctor Who, Steptoe and Son, Allo Allo and much more...

Also, I am an active member of Blackpool Scouts where I am District Youth Commissioner, an assistant Beaver Scout leader, a producer for Blackpool Gang Show and Media and Communications Editor for Blackpool District. In all of these roles, I act as an ambassador for Blackpool Scouts and empower the young people to make their own decisions and be involved in shaping their scouting adventures.

I feel that I have a responsibility to entertain, inspire and engage with an audience; and this sparks my passion for the media, making me determined, focused and enthusiastic about all aspects of media production from writing to editing. I believe film, television and radio are the most important ways to tell a story and use creativity to form relationships with characters you have created to change people's opinions.

Broadcasting is one of the most powerful and influential tools that we have in society and I would love to be a part of the community that makes it happen. My goal is to be a producer or perhaps a director and I believe that through hard work and getting my degree will provide me with a stepping stone to help me achieve this goal.
