I'm a third year student studying BA (Hons) Television and Radio at the University of Salford, MediaCityUK. I am a freelance television runner and an aspiring television editor and studio producer.

Blackpool born and bred. Who doesn't love the going up the tower, riding the Big One, seeing the illuminations and a little stick of Blackpool rock? (cue George Formby)

Since starting at the University of Salford, I've worked on a range of projects from producing TV studio programmes to presenting radio shows and editing documentaries and dramas.

Alongside my studies; I've worked on a number of programmes, such as BBC Songs Of Praise and Britain's Got Talent, to get that step up into the industry and attended multiple events with RTS and MediaCityUK. You can learn more in <a href="/images/cv.pdf"> <strong> my CV </strong> </a>.

A big part of me is Scouting. I'm currently District Youth Commissioner, an assistant Beaver Scout leader, a producer for Blackpool Gang Show and Media and Communications Editor for Blackpool District. In all of these roles, I act as an ambassador for Blackpool Scouts and empower the young people to make their own decisions and be involved in shaping their scouting adventures.

I am proud to have worked with:
