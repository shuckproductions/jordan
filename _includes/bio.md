I'm a second year student studying BA (Hons) Television and Radio at the University of Salford, MediaCityUK. I am a freelance television runner and an aspiring producer.

Blackpool born and bred. Who doesn't love the going up the tower, riding the Big One, seeing the illuminations and a little stick of Blackpool rock? (cue George Formby)

I'm currently a presenter at Shock Radio, Manchester's biggest student radio station. Why not tune in on Thursdays at 10am on <a href="shockradio.co.uk"> shockradio.co.uk. </a>

Original broadcast television is where my love of the media lies; more specifically British TV fictions such as: Fawlty Towers, Doctor Who, Open All Hours, Allo Allo and much more...

A big part of me is Scouting. I'm currently District Youth Commissioner, an assistant Beaver Scout leader, a producer for Blackpool Gang Show and Media and Communications Editor for Blackpool District. In all of these roles, I act as an ambassador for Blackpool Scouts and empower the young people to make their own decisions and be involved in shaping their scouting adventures.

I am proud to have worked with:
