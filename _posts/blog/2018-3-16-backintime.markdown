As mentioned in my previous blog <a href="https://jordanshuck0.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/desert-island-discs.html"> here</a>, this week is all about copyright. I watched BBC Two's <i>Back In Time For Tea, </i>this programme includes a multitude of copyrighted items, for example, appliances, food products, archive footage and music.

This programme suits BBC Two as it is part of the "knowledge-building programming" (BBC Trust, 2016) that BBC Two requires by its remit.

Within the programme, a range of music from the 1980s was used to illustrate the era the family were in during the episode. To be able to use this music, producers of the programme would need to obtain a licence from PPL and PRS who "ensure that the creators&nbsp;and performers of music are paid when their music is used in public" (PPL &amp; PRS, n.d.).

Also, <i>Back In Time For Tea </i>features a variety of footage that is from the 1980s to show the audience what life was really like. This footage is most likely to have come from the BBC Archive. Since this programme is broadcast on BBC Two, it is unlikely that they would need copyright for the use of these clips, however, if clearance was required for this footage the use of the footage would need to be requested to be able to use the BBC content. "BBC Worldwide Ltd sells radio and television clips" (BBC Archives, n.d.) to be used for commercial uses and for non-commercial uses there is an online form for production companies to fill in.

One of the main points of the programme is the old brands and appliances that the family used throughout. This could be considered as product&nbsp;placement within the programme, however, "product placement for licence fee funded services is prohibited under the terms of the BBC Agreement" (BBC, n.d.b). Therefore this would lead me to believe that the products in the programme are not paid placement but are unintentionally shown to promote products
