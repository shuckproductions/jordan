<p>This is my review of last semester and what I&rsquo;ve been up to! I&rsquo;ve worked on numerous projects for my course but we&rsquo;ll get into that soon. I&rsquo;ve also gained more experience in industry working on more programmes for BBC One.</p>

<p>This semester, I've been working on TV documentaries and features, production management and delving into the theory of TV genres. Within TV docs, we worked in pairs to create an observational documentary (something I've never done). Emilia and I found a truly inspring story of a girl called Courtney who has cerebral palsy and donated her hair to the Little Princess Trust. Take a look at the final product <a href="https://youtu.be/zvmylJRzFlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We then moved onto creating a more traditional style documentary on a topic of our own choosing. I found a youth charity, The Boathouse Youth, based in Blackpool who provide amazing experiences to the most vulnerable young people in the town, <a href="https://youtu.be/b4DV8P_d7AE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a watch</a>.</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="https://jordanshuck.uk/images/blog/TBGMug.jpeg" alt="" width="212" height="283" />The production management module really opened my eyes to another side of television, something that interested me and potentially would be an avenue I'd go down in my career. Taught by a PM working in industry, we leanrt budgeting, scheduling, copyright, compliance and much more to set us up to become production managers of the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside university, I was getting valuable experience working on The Big Questions and Songs of Praise for BBC One, even got my mug on the telly!</p>
<p>Two big achievements that came from this half of the year are being presented my Queen's Scout Award at Windsor Castle and being awarded Highly Commended for Breakfast with Jonty and Jordan at the Shock Radio Awards. Now it's time for my big Disney Summer adventure!</p>
