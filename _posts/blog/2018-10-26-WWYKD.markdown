On Friday, I had the opportunity to be a rehearsal stand-in for Jason Manford's programme, 'What Would Your Kid Do?' on ITV.

This was a great experience (not only because I met Jason Manford) but because I got to see how a TV studio show worked.

Since I am currently producing a studio based quiz show for one of my university modules it was interesting to see the similarities and differences between what I was doing an uni and what&nbsp;was done in industry. I picked up a few tips and tricks to apply to my studies and remember for future work in the industry.
